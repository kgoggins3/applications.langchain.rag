  "result": {
    "answer": "Intel's \"IDM 2.0\" strategy, introduced by CEO Pat Gelsinger on March 23, 2021, is a comprehensive plan to revitalize Intel's operations and strengthen its position in the global semiconductor industry. The strategy includes several key components:\n\n1. **Manufacturing Investments**: Significant investments in new manufacturing facilities, including a $20 billion allocation for two fabs in Arizona, aimed at bolstering Intel's internal manufacturing capabilities.\n\n2. **Internal and External Foundries**: A hybrid approach combining the use of Intel's own foundries as well as collaborating with external foundries to meet production demands and enhance flexibility.\n\n3. **Intel Foundry Services (IFS)**: Establishment of a new standalone business unit dedicated to offering foundry services. IFS will provide a mix of Intel's packaging, process technologies, and intellectual property (IP), including x86 cores, to external clients. This marks a shift towards allowing other companies, potentially even competitors, to utilize Intel's manufacturing expertise.\n\n4. **IBM Partnership**: Collaboration with IBM on advanced semiconductor research and innovation to accelerate technological advancements.\n\n5. **Developer Engagement**: Introduction of a new event for developers and engineers called \"Intel ON,\" aimed at fostering innovation and engagement within the technology ecosystem.\n\n6. **7nm Process Development**: Confirmation of progress on Intel's 7nm process technology (Intel 4), with future products like Ponte Vecchio and Meteor Lake planned based on this node.\n\n7. **Global Expansion**: Plans for expansions in countries like Germany (Magdeburg mega fab project) and Ohio (new $20 billion facility) and strategic partnerships for factory funding, such as the $30 billion collaboration with Brookfield Asset Management.\n\nOverall, IDM 2.0 signifies Intel's efforts to regain technological leadership, embrace opportunities in its manufacturing strengths, and compete effectively with rivals like TSMC and AMD.",
