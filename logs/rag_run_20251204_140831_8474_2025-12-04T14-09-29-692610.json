  "query": "Why did Intel face delays in its 10nm process node development?",
  "result": {
    "answer": "Intel faced significant delays in its 10nm process node development due to overly aggressive manufacturing strategies and technical complexities. Initially, Intel planned to introduce 10nm products in 2016 but repeatedly delayed mass production, with the first 10nm processors, Cannon Lake, only being released in limited quantities in 2018. Full mass production was further delayed to 2019.\n\nThe primary reason was Intel's ambitious approach to its 10nm process. The company tried to achieve a higher transistor density than its competitors, requiring five to six multi-pattern steps, compared to the three to four steps used by other foundries. This aggressive scaling made the manufacturing process significantly more complex and prone to issues. Furthermore, Intel's microarchitecture and process node development were tightly coupled, leading to stagnation in processor development due to these manufacturing setbacks. Intel later acknowledged that its approach to shrinking to 10nm was overly aggressive, which contributed to these prolonged delays.",
