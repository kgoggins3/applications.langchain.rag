  "query": "What changes were made to Intel's branding in 2020?",
  "result": {
    "answer": "In 2020, Intel made significant changes to its branding, highlighted by the introduction of a new logo. The redesigned logo retained elements of its past designs, including inspiration from the original 1969 logo and the 2006 \"Intel Inside\" swirl logo. The 2020 logo featured a simplified, refined structure with squared-off corners on the letters \"I\" and \"L\" to convey reliability and endurance. The \"dot\" on the \"I\" became a focal point, symbolizing the power and potential of Intel processors. The updated branding aimed to present Intel as a blend of tradition and modern reliability for the future.",
