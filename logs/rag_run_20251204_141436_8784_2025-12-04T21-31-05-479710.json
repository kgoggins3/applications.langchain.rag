  "query": "What notable security issues have impacted Intel processors in recent years?",
  "result": {
    "answer": "In recent years, Intel processors have been notably impacted by several major security issues:\n\n1. **Transient Execution Vulnerabilities**: These vulnerabilities arise from optimizations such as speculative execution, where instructions are temporarily executed by the microprocessor but not committed due to mispredictions or errors. This can lead to unauthorized leakage of secret data. The most archetypical of these is **Spectre**, a type of side-channel or cache-attack exploit. Since January 2018, numerous cache-attack vulnerabilities have been identified in Intel processors.\n\n2. **Meltdown and Spectre Flaws**: Discovered in early January 2018, these foundational security flaws affected nearly all Intel processors manufactured since 1995 (excluding Intel Itanium and pre-2013 Intel Atom processors). These vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data stored on devices. The issues gained significant attention because they involved fundamental design choices related to speculative execution within the processors.\n\nThese vulnerabilities highlighted critical security challenges in Intel's processor design, prompting widespread updates, patches, and reassessments of microprocessor architectures in the semiconductor industry.",
